/**
 * Listener for channel-related events. Examples are incoming messages,
 * nick changes and joining and leaving users.
 * <p/>
 * Events that are directly related to a channel the connection participates
 * in are processed by <code>ChannelListener</code>s. Additionally, they're
 * told to all <code>ConnectionListener</code>s except for the
 * <code>userStatusChanged</code> event which makes only sense in close relation
 * to a channel and is a redundant event in the sense that is a specialization
 * of <code>channelModeChanged</code>.
 * <p/>
 * Hence, it is possible to gather all information about incoming
 * channel-related events by using only a <code>ConnectionListener</code>.
 * However, in most cases it is a good idea to make use of the specialization
 * <code>ChannelListener</code>.
 * <p/>
 * Generally, the <code>ConnectionListener</code> events are fired directly
 * before the <code>ChannelListener</code> events.
