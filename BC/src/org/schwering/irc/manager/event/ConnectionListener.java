/**
 * A connection listener listens for general events on connection level.
 * <p/>
 * Events that are directly related to a channel the connection participates
 * in are processed by <code>ChannelListener</code>s. Additionally, they're
 * told to all <code>ConnectionListener</code>s.
 * <p/>
 * Hence, it is possible to gather all information about incoming
 * channel-related events by using only a <code>ConnectionListener</code>.
 * However, in most cases it is a good idea to make use of the specialization
 * <code>ChannelListener</code>.
 * <p/>
 * Generally, the <code>ConnectionListener</code> events are fired directly
 * before the <code>ChannelListener</code> or
 * <code>PrivateMessageListener</code> events.
